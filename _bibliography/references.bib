We use a Lagrangian-based numerical model to investigate such floe-floe interactions. Our simulations show that elastic and reversible deformation offers significant resistance to compression before ice floes yield with brittle failure. Compressional strength dramatically decreases once pressure ridges start to form, which implies that thicker sea ice is not necessarily stronger than thinner ice. The mechanical transition is not accounted for in most current sea-ice models that describe ice strength by thickness alone. We propose a parameterization that describes failure mechanics from fracture toughness and Coulomb sliding, improving the representation of ridge building dynamics in particle-based and continuum sea-ice models.

	abstract = {Efforts to manage living marine resources (LMRs) under climate change need projections of future ocean conditions, yet most global climate models (GCMs) poorly represent critical coastal habitats. GCM utility for LMR applications will increase with higher spatial resolution but obstacles including computational and data storage costs, obstinate regional biases, and formulations prioritizing global robustness over regional skill will persist. Downscaling can help address GCM limitations, but significant improvements are needed to robustly support LMR science and management. We synthesize past ocean downscaling efforts to suggest a protocol to achieve this goal. The protocol emphasizes LMR-driven design to ensure delivery of decision-relevant information. It prioritizes ensembles of downscaled projections spanning the range of ocean futures with durations long enough to capture climate change signals. This demands judicious resolution refinement, with pragmatic consideration for LMR-essential ocean features superseding theoretical investigation. Statistical downscaling can complement dynamical approaches in building these ensembles. Inconsistent use of bias correction indicates a need for objective best practices. Application of the suggested protocol should yield regional ocean projections that, with effective dissemination and translation to decision-relevant analytics, can robustly support LMR science and management under climate change.},

	abstract = {Ocean circulation models have systematic errors in large-scale horizontal density gradients due to estimating the grid-cell-mean density by applying the nonlinear seawater equation of state to the grid-cell-mean water properties. In frontal regions where unresolved subgrid-scale (SGS) fluctuations are significant, dynamically relevant errors in the representation of current systems can result. A previous study developed a novel and computationally efficient parameterization of the unresolved SGS temperature variance and resulting density correction. This parameterization was empirically validated but not tested in an ocean model. In this study, we implement deterministic and stochastic variants of this parameterization in the pressure-gradient force term of a coupled ocean-sea ice configuration of CESM-MOM6 and perform a suite of hindcast sensitivity experiments to investigate the ocean response. The parameterization leads to coherent changes in the large-scale ocean circulation and hydrography, particularly in the Nordic Seas and Labrador Sea, which are attributable in large part to changes in the seasonally varying upper-ocean exchange through Denmark Strait. In addition, the separated Gulf Stream strengthens and shifts equatorward, reducing a common bias in coarse-resolution ocean models. The ocean response to the deterministic and stochastic variants of the parameterization is qualitatively, albeit not quantitatively, similar, yet qualitative differences are found in various regions.},

	abstract = {Large tabular icebergs account for the majority of ice mass calved from Antarctic ice shelves, but are omitted from climate models. Specifically, these models do not account for iceberg breakup and as a result, modeled large icebergs could drift to low latitudes. Here, we develop a physically based parameterization of iceberg breakup based on the “footloose mechanism” suitable for climate models. This mechanism describes breakup of ice pieces from the iceberg edges triggered by buoyancy forces associated with a submerged ice foot fringing the iceberg. This foot develops as a result of ocean-induced melt and erosion of the iceberg freeboard explicitly parameterized in the model. We then use an elastic beam model to determine when the foot is large enough to trigger calving, as well as the size of each child iceberg, which is controlled with the ice stiffness parameter. We test the breakup parameterization with a realistic large iceberg calving-size distribution in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory OM4 ocean/sea-ice model and obtain simulated iceberg trajectories and areas that closely match observations. Thus, the footloose mechanism appears to play a major role in iceberg decay that was previously unaccounted for in iceberg models. We also find that varying the size of the broken ice bits can influence the iceberg meltwater distribution more than physically realistic variations to the footloose decay rate.},

	abstract = {Turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer leads to the presence of a surface mixed layer. This mixed layer is important for many phenomena including large-scale ocean dynamics, ocean-atmosphere coupling, and biological and biogeochemical processes. Analysis of the ocean mixed layer requires one to estimate its vertical extent, for which there are various definitions. Correspondingly, there are uncertainties on how to best identify an ocean surface mixed layer for a given application. We propose defining the MLD from energetic principles through the potential energy (PE). The PE based MLD is based on the concept of PE anomaly, which measures the stratification of a layer of seawater by estimating its energetic distance from a well-mixed state. We apply the PE anomaly to diagnose the MLD as the depth to which a given energy could homogenize a layer of seawater. We evaluate the MLD defined by common existing methods and demonstrate that they contain a wide range of PE anomalies for the same MLD, particularly evident for deep winter mixed layers. The MLD defined from the PE anomaly ensures a more consistent MLD identified for a large range of stratifications. Furthermore, the PE method relates to the turbulent kinetic energy budget of the ocean surface boundary layer, which is fundamental to upper ocean mixing processes and parameterizations. The resulting MLD is more representative of active boundary layer turbulence, and is more robust to small anomalies in seawater properties.},

We present a physically motivated surface mass flux closure, that results in: reduced watermass drift from initialization; improved Atlantic meridional overturning cirulation intensity; and more realistic rates of ocean heat uptake, in simulations using global ocean/sea-ice/land (MOM6/SIS2/LM3) model configurations, forced with atmospheric reanalysis data. In addition to accounting for the land storage, the area-integrated subpolar-to-polar (40°–90°N/S) surface mass fluxes are constrained, using a climatological estimate derived from the the CMIP6 historical ensemble, which helps to further improve hindcast performance. Simulations using MERRA-2 and JRA55-do forcing, subject to identical hydrologic constraints, exhibit similar reductions in drift.},

The model has intermediate complexity, incorporating basin-scale geometry with idealized Atlantic and Southern oceans and with non-uniform ocean depth to allow for mesoscale eddy interactions with topography. The model is perfectly adiabatic and spans the Equator and thus fills a gap between quasi-geostrophic models, which cannot span two hemispheres, and idealized general circulation models, which generally include diabatic processes and buoyancy forcing. We show that the model solution is approaching convergence in mean kinetic energy for the ocean mesoscale processes of interest and has a rich range of dynamics with circulation features that emerge only due to resolving mesoscale turbulence.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Chicxulub crater is the site of an asteroid impact linked with the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction at ∼66 Ma. This asteroid struck in shallow water and caused a large tsunami. Here we present the first global simulation of the Chicxulub impact tsunami from initial contact of the projectile to global propagation. We use a hydrocode to model the displacement of water, sediment, and crust over the first 10 min, and a shallow-water ocean model from that point onwards. The impact tsunami was up to 30,000 times more energetic than the 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, one of the largest tsunamis in the modern record. Flow velocities exceeded 20 cm/s along shorelines worldwide, as well as in open-ocean regions in the North Atlantic, equatorial South Atlantic, southern Pacific and the Central American Seaway, and therefore likely scoured the seafloor and disturbed sediments over 10,000 km from the impact origin. The distribution of erosion and hiatuses in the uppermost Cretaceous marine sediments are consistent with model results.},

	abstract = {We highlight the differing roles of vorticity and strain in the transport of coarse-grained scalars at length scales larger than ℓ by smaller scale (subscale) turbulence. We use the first term in a multiscale gradient expansion due to Eyink [J. Fluid Mech. 549, 159 (2006)], which exhibits excellent correlation with the exact subscale physics when the partitioning length ℓ is any scale smaller than that of the spectral peak. We show that unlike subscale strain, which acts as an anisotropic diffusion/antidiffusion tensor, subscale vorticity's contribution is solely a conservative advection of coarse-grained quantities by an eddy-induced nondivergent velocity, v∗, that is proportional to the curl of vorticity. Therefore, material (Lagrangian) advection of coarse-grained quantities is accomplished not by the coarse-grained flow velocity, ¯¯¯uℓ, but by the effective velocity, ¯¯¯uℓ+v∗, the physics of which may improve commonly used LES models.},

	abstract = {In December 2020, giant tabular iceberg A68a (surface area 3900 km2) broke up in open ocean much deeper than its keel, indicating that the breakage was not immediately caused by collision with the seafloor. Giant icebergs with lengths exceeding 18.5 km account for most of the calved ice mass from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Upon calving, they drift away and transport freshwater into the Southern Ocean, modifying ocean circulation, disrupting sea ice and the marine biosphere, and potentially triggering changes in climate. Here, we demonstrate that the A68a breakup event may have been triggered by ocean-current shear, a new breakup mechanism not previously reported. We also introduce methods to represent giant icebergs within climate models that currently do not have any representation of them. These methods open opportunities to explore the interactions between icebergs and other components of the climate system and will improve the fidelity of global climate simulations.},
