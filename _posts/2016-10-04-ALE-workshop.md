title: Flavors of ALE
description: ALE workshop held at NOAA-NWS in 2016
---

In this presentation I describe two flavors of the ALE method.  These two
flavors arise from my interpretation of how the original methods of Hirt, 1974
and Bleck, 2002 descriptions differ, as well as a result of trying to implement
ALE in MOM6 and realizing certain choices lead to different capabilities.
